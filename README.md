# WaterRegionEstimationLandsat
Land cover classification and investigation of temporal changes are considered to be common applications of remote sensing. Water/non-water region estimation is one of the most fundamental classification tasks, analyzing the occurrence of water on the Earthâ€™s surface. However, common remote sensing practices such as thresholding, spectral analysis, and statistical approaches are not sufficient to produce a globally adaptable water classification. The aim of this study is to develop a formula with automatically derived tuning parameters using perceptron neural networks for water/non-water region estimation, which we call the Perceptron-Derived Water Formula (PDWF), using Landsat-8 images.

Landsat-8 data can be downloaded, unzip and kept in the defined loc folder (here it is 'Landsat_data') also a text file represent the the list of the datas kep at loc folder (here it is 'list_.txt')
